6. How do you remove a directory and can you remove non-empty directories in Linux? Provide an example

The rm by default does not remove directories. To remove a directory use rm with the -r option. In Linux and other Nix systems you cannot remove non empty directories. To remove empty directories use the rmdir command. To remove non-empty directories use rm -r + directory name ir directory absolute path.  

**Examples:**
* rmdir Downloads/games: remove an empty directory
* rm -r Downloads/games: remove an non-empty directory

7. Explain the mv and cp command. Provide 2 examples of each

mv command moves and renames directories. 
The formula of the mv command is: mv + source + destination
For renaming files/directories the formula is: mv + file/directory to rename + new name

**Examples:**
* mv Downloads/homework.pdf Documents/: to move a file from a directory to another using relative path
* mv games/ wallpapers/ rockmusic/ /media/student/flashdrive/: to move multiple directories/files to a different directory
* mv ~/Downloads/homework.docx ~/Downloads/cis106homework/.docx: to rename a file using absolute path
* mv Downloads/cis106homework.docx Documents/new_cis106homework.docx

cp command copies files/directories from a source to a destination. 
The formula of the cp command is: cp + files to copy + destination
To copy directories use the -r option: cp -r + directory to copy + destination 

**Examples:**
* cp -r ~/Downloads/wallpapers ~/Pictures/: to copy a directory with absolute path
* cp Downloads/wallpapers/* ~/Pictures/: to copy the content of a directory to another directory
* sudo cp -r script.sh program.py home.html assets/ /var/www/html/: to copy multiple files in a single command
